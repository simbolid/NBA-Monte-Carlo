# Parallelizing Elo-Based Predictions for the 2024 NBA Playoffs

Project for Lehigh University CSE 375: Parallel Programming

We create an elo-based prediction model for the 2024 NBA Playoffs. 
We then run 10,000 simulations using this model.
Our goal is to improve the runtime of these simulations. 

### Running the Code

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python elo.py
```
